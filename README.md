# vswiki

A personal wiki project. Because at the last count, there were only
9999 different wiki implementations. And to try out the latest
versions of tools, mainly Rails 4.0.


## Features

TBD, but the target is *not* a "full-featured" wiki; rather, will
cherry-pick features based on which ones are useful and/or interesting
to me. The target usage environment is on a local machine, or a
restricted/controlled environment, such as a home network. For
example, currently not planning to implement user logins,
authentication & authorization.


## Tools & Dependencies

* Rails 4.0
* RSpec & Capybara
* PostgreSQL, also in development & test environments
